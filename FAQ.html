<tr class ="unknown"><td class="questions">Why did you make this?</td><td class="questions">Short answer is to challenge myself, along with having a quick reference for preflop percentages to influence decision making.</td></tr>
<tr class ="unknown"><td class="questions">What does this do?</td><td class="questions">Right now its just a simple html website, all the data is already filled in. Click on your starting hand and you will see your percentage to win/tie against all hands</td></tr>
<tr class ="unknown"><td class="questions">Your percentages are incorrect! The data is a lie!</td><td class="questions">The data is correct. However it makes several assumptions. They are its one versus one, and you and opponent never have the same suit. This gives kk a higher chance to crack aces since your flush will come more often. This is less than a percent difference at all times.</td></tr>
<tr class ="unknown"r><td class="questions">Thats it? This is only useful for yourself.</td><td class="questions">I hope others can find the value this offers. This program will never tell you what to do, just give you more information so you can make better decisions.</td></tr>
<tr class ="unknown"><td class="questions">Are you done working on this? What is coming next?</td><td class="questions">This is by no means finished. This is version 1 that will be public and I will keep working on expanding the features and functions and hopefully release a paid version someday.</td></tr>
